# Exercise 8

## SOLANA TOKENS

This section needs us to create and experiment with Fungible and Non-Fungible Tokens using `spl-token-cli`.

Following are the tasks that need to be performed:

1. Create a fungible token with supply of 10,000
2. Create a Non-Fungible Token
3. Try sending these tokens to your teams
4. Also check upon the details of these tokens
5. Do use `transfer` and `transfer --fund-recipient` commands to send tokens

All these can be done by taking [this](https://solana.bootcampnotes.xyz/lesson6.html#/5) particular lesson in consideration.
