# Decentralized Systems

1. Discuss in your teams what a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be like, if there was no software on a central server.

Consider the following questions:

- What are the essential pieces of functionality?
- How could people cheat?
- How could you prevent them from cheating?

This is just a general discussion, there is no need to write any code or do any design.

2. Do you feel that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are a move towards decentralisation? Will they help or hinder adoption of other cryptocurrencies?
